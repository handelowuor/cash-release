# SunCulture Expense Management System - Backend Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance for implementing the backend services required by the SunCulture Expense Management System. The frontend application is built with Next.js and requires a robust backend API to handle authentication, data storage, and business logic.

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Core Technologies

- **Node.js/Express.js or Django**: For API development
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for structured data
- **Redis**: For caching and session management
- **OAuth 2.0**: For authentication (already integrated with the frontend)
- **AWS S3 or equivalent**: For file storage (receipts, attachments)

## Implementation Priorities

Implement the backend services in the following order of priority:

### Phase 1: Core Authentication and User Management

1. Authentication endpoints (login, refresh token, user info)
2. User management endpoints (CRUD operations)
3. Permission and role management

### Phase 2: Expense Management

1. Expense CRUD operations
2. Approval workflows
3. File upload for attachments
4. Advance management

### Phase 3: Budget Management

1. Budget CRUD operations
2. Department budget allocation
3. Budget reporting

### Phase 4: Reporting and Dashboard

1. Dashboard data endpoints
2. Reporting endpoints
3. Export functionality

## Database Schema Considerations

- Follow the data models defined in the frontend Models directory
- Implement proper foreign key relationships
- Consider using database views for complex reporting queries
- Implement proper indexing for performance optimization

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- Ensure proper authorization checks for all endpoints

## Integration Points

The backend will need to integrate with:

1. **AMT for refunds**: Implement webhook handlers and API clients
2. **NetSuite for payments**: Develop integration services
3. **Slack for notifications**: Use Slack API for sending notifications
4. **Email services**: Implement email sending functionality
5. **Scale for procurement budget checks**: Develop integration services

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing for critical endpoints
- Security testing (penetration testing)

## Deployment Considerations

- Set up CI/CD pipelines
- Implement proper environment configuration
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Implement database backup strategies
- Consider containerization with Docker

## Documentation

- Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI
- Document database schema
- Create integration guides for third-party services

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment
2. Create the database schema
3. Implement the authentication endpoints
4. Develop the core user management functionality
5. Proceed with expense management endpoints
